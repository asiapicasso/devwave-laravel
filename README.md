## About this Project

Laravel is a php framework for managing websites.

The database was built directly in MySQL to familiarize myself with this language. Then it was migrated to the laravel base tables.

The aim was to make a backend project so as not to waste time on the views, they were made with Blade.

This project was made in 4 days alongside my other courses.
